Hi guys,
You can find the script I did for a project.

You have 2 important file.
First 1 is "API_Encrypt.PS1" where you can securise API credentials given specially to your account dell pro.
Keys will be exported to TXT where you want.
Second one is the script that use those key and ask the dell API "Warranty_Dell.PS1".
